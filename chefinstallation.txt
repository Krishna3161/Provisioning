Chef Server:
Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang. Using Chef server you can manage a large number of servers. In Simple words you can define it as a central server which distributes the configuration details to every node those are registered with it. It helps to automate the application deployment and relevant environment setup. You can integrate with cloud-based platforms such as Rackspace, Amazon EC2, Linode and DigitalOcean to automatically provision and configure new machines.
You have to write “recipes” which describes how Chef manages server applications like Apache, MySQL, Nginx etc.. and how they are to be configured in the machine. These recipes describe a series of resources that should be in a particular state: packages that should be installed, services that should be running, or files that should be written. Chef makes sure each resource is properly configured and corrects any resources that are not in the desired state.
